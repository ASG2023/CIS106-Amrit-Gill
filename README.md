# CIS106-Amrit-Gill

## Assignment 1
I’m a returning student after 2-3 years to Harper to take this class for transfer credit to DePaul, as well as restart my # learning of programming for my future career in Cloud DevOps. I’ve been working as a contractor for the Navy for the past year and still am Service support. I live in Elk Grove Village, not too far from Harper, past 2 years I’ve been going back and forth from here to San Diego, Cali for work.

When it comes to programming, the last time I did anything related to programming was 3-4 years ago. I would like to restart in python and C++ as that’s what my current company looks at for employees to know.

The area in programming I would like to know from this class as well are Array logic and String/File Logic as those are new to me. I hope to learn and have fun with everyone in this class.
